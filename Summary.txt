I ran a grocery store simulation with shoppers buying 10–40 items and tested different numbers of checkers.

- 3 checkers: 3.36 min wait, 274 min idle  
- 4 checkers: 2.96 min wait, 474 min idle  
- 5 checkers: 2.94 min wait, 656 min idle  
- 6 checkers: 2.90 min wait, 842 min idle  

Adding more checkers reduced wait time, but only slightly after 4. Idle time increased, making extra checkers less efficient.

I also tested shoppers with more items (10–50 up to 10–100). As item count increased, wait times got longer (up to 5.91 min), and checkers stayed busier.

- With 10–50 items, the wait time was 3.49 minutes
- With 10–70 items, the wait time was 4.62 minutes
- With 10–100 items, the wait time reached 5.91 minutes

In summary, the best setup is to balances wait time and idle time. Too few checkers cause delays, but too many increase idle time without much benefit.
